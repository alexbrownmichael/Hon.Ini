                                <p>Comrade Ini Ememobong is a Nigerian politician. He is the current commissioner for information and strategy in Akwa Ibom State and the immediate past state publicity secretary of Peoples Democratic Party in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria. He is the founder of Ini Ememobong Foundation.</p>
								<p> 
                                    He was born on 7 November 1983. He is the second son in the family of Mkpisong Ememobong and Rosemary Essien. [2]

                                    He started his education at Calabar Preparatory Nursery School. In 1987, at the creation of Akwa Ibom State, his family relocated to Ikot Ekpene where he continued his primary education at Holy Child International Nursery and Primary School, Ikot Ekpene.[3][4][5]
                                    
                                    He  demonstrated an unusual intelligence from a very tender age and was severally favoured as the school's representative in many external events including participation in the then famous Young Brains TV programme of the Akwa Ibom State Broadcasting Corporation (AKBC).[6]
                                    
                                    He later moved to St. Mary's Science College, Abak where he emerged as the Editor-in-Chief of the School's Press Club. He was also a compere at many events on campus.[6]
                                    
                                    In 2000, he was offered admission to study Linguistics and Nigerian Languages and in 2005, he obtained the Bachelor of Arts degree in Linguistics. It was in his time that the department witnessed a renaissance, particularly in student's politics and socials. His effective and fervent interventions and advocacy remains indelible in the minds of his colleagues. It is acknowledged that he motivated other students in the department to contest for elections within and outside the department.[3][4]
                                    
                                    Upon graduation, he was mobilized for the National Youth Service Scheme and posted to Taraba. At camp, he served with OBS (the media house of the camp). He was subsequently posted to Darul Arkam Koranic school, where he taught English Language. He became the first chairman of the Editorial Board CDS group in Taraba. Using that office, he published the first newsletter by NYSC Taraba. He published this newsletter by taking a loan from the NYSC, using his allowance as the collateral. He started an inspiration talk show on radio Taraba and in less than three months the show became quite popular. While in Taraba, he was hosted by top dignitaries like the Deputy Governor, the Emir of Muri, among others, in recognition of his excellent services to their state.
                                    
                                    In 2007, he gained admission to study Law at the University of Uyo . In 2012, he completed his LL.B programme and in 2013, he proceeded to the Nigerian Law School, Enugu Campus and was called to the Nigerian Bar as Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in 2014.[citation needed]
                                    
                                    In 2016, he enrolled to study for a master's degree in Peace and conflict Studies, and very recently completed the course thus acquiring an M.A in Peace and Conflict studies</p>
